# NeoVIM Configuration using NixNeovim

This is my NeoVIM configuration using
[NixNeovim](https://github.com/NixNeovim/NixNeovim). It is only suppossed to
support my use case so only use it as a reference and do not depend on it.

## Requirements

You **must** have:

- [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

You **may** need:

- Nixpkgs unstable
- A NixOS flake configuration

That is what I use, therefore I do not consider any other cases in my
configuration.

## Usage

Check `examples/flake.nix` and `examples/home.nix` (I don't promise I will keep these up to date):
